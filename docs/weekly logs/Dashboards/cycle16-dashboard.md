### Overview
Our testing coverage is excellent and is at 98%, and aside from the populating the DB with the grades and feedback post AI grading, we are almost complete with majority of the features of the project from our initial project plan, with only the notification system left to be finished for the next cycle, and incorporating feedback from the peer testing.
