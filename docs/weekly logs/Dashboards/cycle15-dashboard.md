### Overview
Our testing coverage is excellent and is almost at 97%, and aside from the AI file uploads for the grading, we are almost complete with most features of the project from our initial project plan, with only the notification system and the AI grading being the features left to be finished for the next cycle, and incorporating feedback from the peer testing.
