## Progress Update (since 6/12/2024)

| TASK/ISSUE # | STATUS      |
|--------------|-------------|
| Task 1       | Complete    |
| Task 2       | In Progress, waiting on login to be implemented |
| Task 3       | In Progress, worked on functionality, unable to test till login and signup works fully |
| Task 4       | In Progress, login and signup fixing taking time from this task  |
| Task 5       | In Progress, began research on how to handle user roles, need to implement after login and signup |
| Task 6       | In Progress, have some initial tests written, but wating on login and signup to work before we can focus on testing it fully with detailed test cases |

## Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

I completed Task 1 as planned, but Tasks 2-5 are in progress and depend on the login and signup to work before, I can test and implement them, and we decided to get it working as a group, so it took us a while to diagnose the issues, and took time away from tasks 2-6.

## Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)

- Goal 1: To get the forgot password functionality working
- Goal 2: To get role-based access of resources working
- Goal 3: To add in automated testing with DroneCI
- Goal 4: To get detailed testing done for user management, and course management
