During this cycle, I took over Aayush's issue #294 and finished implementing AI prompt CRUD features for the professor users. As this is a shorter cycle, only two days long, I feel it has been a productive cycle for me. I also implemented backend unit testing for the new routes I created. 

# Next Cycle 
During the next cycle, I'll work with my teammates to implement the AI grading, add more unit tests, and fix any existing bugs. I'm also assigned to do the student view of assignment page, and archiving a course(if time permits)

| Task #3 | Postponed after MVP  |
| Task #4 | Ongoing |
| Task #5 | Completed |

# Cycle Goal Review
During this cycle, I had to face a challenge where the dev branch was contaminated by one of the merges. More than 7000-line of code were removed from dev branch. Thus I researched and executed a roll-back to previous commit. As a result, three merges were reverted which needs to be re-merged again. I executed a "cherry-pick commit" on these three branches, and made sure the dev branch stays in a working state. These tasks occupied most of my working time during this cycle.

# Next Cycle 
Backend testing, continue to implement backend features. We have come up with a list of all the remaining tasks. We are going to meet after the MVP presentation to divide the work.

# Cycle Goal Review
During this cycle, I spent most of my time implementing new features - tasks #1-3; The remainder of my time was spent on fixing bugs and solving merge conflicts. At this point there are still unsolved merge conflicts; I can foresee that it will occupy a large chunk of my time during the next cycle.

# Next Cycle 
The focus of the next cycle is to implement as many tests as possible, both unit tests and manual tests to ensure all existing features work flawlessly.
If time permits, the new features I'm going to work on next are to implement assignment fetching logic for evaluators, and create rubric features for evaluators.

There are other known issues; I will fix them and list them on the Kanban board as we progress.
