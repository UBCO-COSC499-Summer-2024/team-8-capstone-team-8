### Cycle Goal Review 
I reviewed the project design documents as planned. I started working on the front-end Login/logout design page and began learning React. However, the front-end work is still in progress.

### Next Cycle Goals 
  * Goal 1: Continue working on the front-end Login/logout design page
  * Goal 2: Further learning and implementing React
  * Goal 3: Start integrating the back-end with the front-end
Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

### Cycle Goal Review 
I have been working on the backend for a single selected rubric and the publish assignment rubric backend for a long time. However, I am encountering some errors that I need to discuss with my teammates. It seems these issues might be related to the database.
