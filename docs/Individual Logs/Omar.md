| ----------- | --- |
| Task #1 / Issue #58  | Completed  |
| Task #2 / Issue #119 | Completed  |
| Task #3 / Issue #60 | In Progress  |

I successfully tackled Task 1, investing considerable effort in debugging and resolving errors. Task 2 presented a significant challenge, requiring extensive setup of the backend before achieving functionality. While I completed both tasks, there remains room for further refinement and improvement.

# Next Cycle Goals

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)
This cycle I worked on testing, backend, and frontend. Testing was a bit challenging since I didn't have much experience in it, but I got the backend tests to pass. 

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
For the next cycle, I will focus mainly on the frontend since my team members and I decided to finish with the frontend as soon as possible. After that, I will focus on the backend and get most of my issues done.

This cycle was in real depth for backend and it was a little bit challenging since i haven't worked with the backend in a while but I managed to understand it so I can move forward confidentially! Also, merging PR's and testing them took a while since we let them sit for a while without reviewing them.

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
- Review PR's and merge them
- Display student backend for eval 
- Display all evals from the database in eval manager
- Create acc prof ta admin portal

### Cycle Goal Review (Reflection: what went well, what was done, what didn't; Retrospective: how is the process going and why?)

### Next Cycle Goals (What are you going to accomplish during the next cycle)
- I will focus on testing and 2 issues that I haven't finished since the frontend for them was not done.
