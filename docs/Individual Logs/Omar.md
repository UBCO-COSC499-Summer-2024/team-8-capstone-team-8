Progress Update: 
# Progress Update (since June 7)
| Task/Iusse# | Status |
| ----------- | --- |
| Task #1 / Issue #58  | Completed  |
| Task #2 / Issue #119 | Completed  |
| Task #3 / Issue #60 | In Progress  |

I successfully tackled Task 1, investing considerable effort in debugging and resolving errors. Task 2 presented a significant challenge, requiring extensive setup of the backend before achieving functionality. While I completed both tasks, there remains room for further refinement and improvement.

# Next Cycle Goals
- Task 3
- Assign myself more tasks and get them done in a timely manner
